### 3 capture occasions, 2 time intervals

n.mark <- 150
marked <- c(n.mark, 0)  # Number of newly marked individuals each year

# Vectors of values for phi and p for each year
# Each vector needs to have (n.occasions - 1) values or fewer and have values 
#  between 0 and 1. If it's fewer, the values will be recycled
# Here, we just give 1 value and it's used in every year
phi <- 0.8 # or, for example, could use phi <- c(0.6, 0.9)

???

+ For example, imagine you go on the field 3 times, and three capture or sampling occasions.
+ Three occasions mean 2 time intervals
+ You get these data, with 1's and 0's for detected or non-detected
+ Detected = captured or observed
+ Everything is fine when you get all 1's, or even 0's between 1's
+ But what if 110 or 100, did the individual die or did it run undetected?

## Parameters

???

+ We're gonna need some parameters to describe the fate of individuals

---

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/param1.png")
```

???

+ Three capture or sampling occasions then

---

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/param2.png")
```

???

+ We need survival parameters, or the probability of being alive and present at a given occasion, and still present and alive at the next occasion
+ This is for example $\phi_1$ survival over the first interval
+ Or $\phi_2$ survival over the second time interval
+ We also need recapture probabilities, $p_2$ and $p_3$ recapture probabilities at second and third occasions
+ You might ask what about $p_1$? Well because we mark at first occasion, the detection probability is necessarily 1 so no need to estimate it. 

---
## Definition of parameters

--

+ Parameter $\phi_i$ is the probability that a marked animal in the population at sampling occasion $i$ survives until occasion $i+1$ and remains in the population (does not permanently emigrate). 

--

+ Parameter $p_i$ is the probability that a marked animal in the population is detected (captured or observed) at sampling occasion $i$.

--

+ While detection operates at a sampling occasion, survival operates over a time interval. 

--

+ How to estimate these parameters from the data we have?

???

+ Let's agree on a formal definition of survival and detection parameters.

## Encounter histories

???

Now we're fully equiped to work out what happens in the life of our animals. 

---

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/cjs1.png")
```

???

+ Back to our example with 3 capture or sampling occasions. 

---

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/cjs2.png")
```

???

+ First things first, you get captured, marked and released in the population.

---

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/cjs3.png")
```

???

+ Then you may stay alive and present over the time interval.
+ Or you may die or emigrate

---

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/cjs4.png")
```

???

+ If you're alive, you are available to detection, then you get detected or not. 

---

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/cjs5.png")
```

???

+ These events occur with some probabilities.
+ For example...

---

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/cjs6.png")
```

???

+ Then again, if you were alive and detected, you may remain alive or die/emigrate. Same thing if you were alive and undetected. And on the third occasion, you get detected or not. 

---

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/cjs7.png")
```

???

+ These successive events lead to encounter histories, series of 1's and 0's. 
+ For example... 
+ Note that several paths can lead to the same encounter history, for example 110. 

---
class: center, middle
background-size: cover

## Probabilities

???

+ From there, it's fairly easy to write down the probability for each encounter history.

---

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/eh1.png")
```

???

+ Take 111 for example. 

---

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/eh2.png")
```


---

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/eh3.png")
```

???

+ The encounter history 110 is a bit trickier to deal with
+ Because two paths may lead to it
+ But because these paths are exclusive, we just need to write down the probability for each, and sum them up


---

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/eh4.png")
```

---

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/eh5.png")
```

---

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/eh6.png")
```


---
### Probabilities of all possible encounter histories with 3 occasions

+ $\Pr(111) = \phi_1 p_2 \phi_2 p_3$
+ $\Pr(110) = \phi_1 p_2 (1-\phi_2 p_3)$
+ $\Pr(101) = \phi_1 (1-p_2) \phi_2 p_3$
+ $\Pr(100) = 1-\phi_1 p_2 -\phi_1(1-p_2)\phi_2 p_3$

???

+ If you do the work for all the possible encounter histories, you get
+ Where do we go from here? 
+ Remember our goal is to estimate survival and detection probabilities.

## Model likelihood

???

+ We're going to work with something Aurelien already introduced you with, the model likelohood. 
+ The core of statistical inference, whether you're a frequentist or a Bayesian. 

---
### Likelihood

--

+ When survival and detection probabilities vary over time, we call it the Cormack-Jolly-Seber model.

--

+ Its likelihood is $L(\mbox{data}\;|\;\mbox{parameters}) = \Pr(\mbox{data}\; | \; \phi_1,\phi_2,p_2,p_3)$.

--

+ You get maximum likelihood estimates by maximising the likelihood function (!) $L(\mbox{parameters}\;|\;\mbox{data})$.

--

+ It is $L = \mbox{constant} \times \Pr(111)^{n_{111}} \times \Pr(110)^{n_{110}} \times \Pr(101)^{n_{101}} \times \Pr(100)^{n_{100}}$.

--

+ We search for $\phi_1,\phi_2,p_2,p_3$ that maximize the likelihood function.

--

+ Let's inspect visually the likelihood function in the simple case where all parameters are constant over time, that is $\phi_1 = \phi_2 = \phi$ and $p_2 = p_3 = p$.

# Sex effect

--

## What does survival actually mean in capture-recapture ?

--

+ Survival refers to the study area.

--

+ Mortality and permanent emigration are confounded.

--

+ Therefore we estimate apparent survival, not true survival.

--

+ Apparent survival probability = true survival × study area fidelity.

--

+ Consequently, apparent survival < true survival unless study area fidelity = 1.

--

+ Use caution when interpreting survival. If possible, combine with ring-recovery data, or go spatial to get closer to true survival.

## Sites may be states.

## Examples of multistate models

+ *Epidemiological or disease states*: sick/healthy, uninfected/infected/recovered.

--

+ *Morphological states*: small/medium/big,  light/medium/heavy.

--

+ *Breeding states*: e.g. breeder/non-breeder, failed breeder, first-time breeder, breeder with 1 or 2 offspring. 

--

+ *Developmental or life-history states*: e.g. juvenile/subadult/adult.

--

+ *Social states*: e.g. solitary/group-living,  subordinate/dominant.

--

+ *Death states*: e.g. alive, dead from harvest, dead from natural causes. 

--

&nbsp;

**States = individual, time-specific categorical covariates.**

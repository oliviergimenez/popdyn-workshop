## Population dynamics

```

???

+ This workshop deals with the analysis and modelling of population dynamics. 
+ Quantifying population dynamics is crucial for the conservation and management of animal and plant species. 
+ We hope to have given you some tools to start working on your own.

## Take-home messages and recommendations

???

+ We'll wrap up the workshop with a few take-home messages 
+ And recommendations for conducting your own analyses.

## The art of modelling

???

+ Before we leave, we'd like to give you a few pieces of advice.
+ This is not rocket science.
+ Just a few things based on our own experience.

--

+ Make your ecological question explicit. 

???

+ First things first. Make sure you've spent some to time to make your ecological question explicit. 
+ This step will help you to stay on course, and make the right choices. 
+ For example, it's ok to use subsets of your data to address different questions. 

--

+ Think of your model. 

???

+ Now in terms of modeling. Don't jump on your keyboard right away. 
+ Spend some time thinking about your model with pen and paper. 

--

+ Start simple. Make sure everything runs smoothly.

???

+ When it comes to model fitting, start simple. 
+ Consider all parameters constant. 
+ Make sure everything runs smoothly.

--

+ Add complexity one step at a time. 

???

+ Then add complexity. Time effect for example. Or random effects.
+ Or uncertainty in the assignment of states. 

---
## Simulations

+ Use simulations to better understand your model. 

+ R is the perfect tool for simulations. 

+ Model is an engine to generate data, instead of estimating parameters.

???

+ When it comes to model building, consider simulating data to better understand your model. 
+ R is the perfect tool.
+ You will always learn something on your model by seeing it an engine to generate data, instead of estimating its parameters.

## Till next time

--

+ Website will be updated with

    + video recordings
    + your feedbacks

???

+ We will update the workshop website in the coming weeks. 
+ With the video recordings of course. 
+ Any feedback you might have. Please get in touch with me if you have any, that would be great. 

--

+ Please, fill in feedback form at <https://forms.gle/XoXvz58RQq6kAMT38>. Will hep us to improve materials and delivery for next time. 

--

+ A book is on its way. More in 2023 hopefully.

???

+ And last, a book is on its way. Based on the material we used for the workshop and more stuff. 
+ More in 2023 hopefully.
